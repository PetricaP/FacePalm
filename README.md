# FacePalm
This was my project for our Databases class, I have screenshots and details about the project in the documentation section. It was a basic social network where you could send friend requests and have friends, have groups of people as well as posts on those groups. You could also create posts on your main page similar to Facebook. Unfortunately I haven't gotten to implementing messaging and didn't even know what Websockets were at that point.

I also used this project for my Web Development class, where I migrated the code to NodeJS and EJS instead of Python and Flask. The code for that is on a separate branch.
